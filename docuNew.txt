1. Project Overview

This is an interactive web application—think mapgenie.io but for a game called Vaultbreakers, an extraction shooter in the vein of Escape from Tarkov. Users can pan/zoom around a custom game map and view markers representing lootable enemies, chests, quest locations, vendors, and more. There’s a public “read-only” side for general players, and an authenticated “admin” side that unlocks modals for defining and editing those markers.

2. File Layout & Responsibilities

Root & Config

index.html: Main entrypoint that loads Leaflet, your scripts, and CSS.

package.json/package-lock.json: NPM metadata and dependency lock for builds.

.gitignore: Excludes node_modules/, media/ (migrated to Cloudinary), and sensitive files like serviceAccountKey.json.

serviceAccountKey.json: Firebase admin credentials—only used by grantAdmin.js and must never be committed without caution.

firebaseConfig.js (in src/): Exports your Firebase client config for initialization in the browser.

Media

media/images/: Temporary local images (tempmap.png, item sprites). Soon to be replaced by Cloudinary CDN URLs.

media/videos/: Example clips (e.g. TPexample.mp4) for onboarding or demos.

Scripts (scripts/)

Entrypoint & Auth

script.js: Orchestrates app startup, listens for Firebase Auth state, toggles admin UI, and hydrates markers.

authSetup.js & grantAdmin.js: Handle user sign-in flows and granting the lone admin user their Firestore privileges.

Map Modules (modules/map/)

map.js: Initializes Leaflet map, configures bounds and base overlay.

markerManager.js: Renders markers, custom icons, and popups (items, chests, NPCs, quests).

copyPasteManager.js: Enables right-click copy/paste of marker positions for rapid map editing.

Services (modules/services/)

firebaseService.js: Wraps Firestore calls (load, upsert, real-time subscriptions).

*DefinitionsService.js (item, chest, npc, quest): CRUD and subscription logic per collection.

UI Core (modules/ui/)

uiKit.js, uiManager.js, pickrManager.js: Modal scaffolding, drag/drop, color-picker instantiation.

definitionModalShell.js, definitionListManager.js: Shared modal structure and list filtering/rendering.

layoutSwitcher.js: Toggles between grid/list or other page layouts.

Forms & Modals (ui/forms/ & ui/modals/): Each entity (item, chest, npc, quest, marker) has a builder, controller, and modal to edit definitions.

Entries & Previews (ui/entries/, ui/preview/): Renderers for sidebar entries and preview panels when hovering or clicking a marker.

Utilities (modules/utils/)

colorPresets.js & colorUtils.js: Maps type → hex color (default global “white” is #E5E6E8), utility functions for applying palettes.

listUtils.js, formUtils.js, iconUtils.js, scrollUtils.js, utils.js: General-purpose helpers for DOM, deep-clone, scrolling, icon creation, and more.

Styles (styles/)

Global: base.css and ui.css establish resets, typography, and the default white background #E5E6E8.

Components:

Modals: modal.base.css, modal.small.css, modal.large.css, plus per-entity modal styles under styles/modals/.

Previews: previewPanel.css, chestPreview.css, itemPreview.css, npcPreview.css.

Sidebar & Leaflet: sidebar.css, context-menu.css, custom-markers.css, popup.css, leaflet.css.

Every file starts with a header comment reminding contributors not to remove or alter those license/comment lines unless the adjacent code is also updated—and to include clear inline comments explaining each function’s responsibility.

3. Hosting, Deployment & Dependencies

GitHub Pages hosts the static site under your project’s repository. Your CI/CD isn’t elaborate—pushing to main triggers GitHub Pages to serve the updated index.html, JS, and CSS artifacts.

Firebase Firestore (client SDK in the browser) stores all marker definitions. The client initializes Firebase using firebaseConfig.js, and every CRUD call goes through firebaseService.js. Real-time listeners keep the public map in sync.

Cloudinary CDN is the planned home for all media assets. Currently you point to local files in media/images/, but once uploaded, those URLs replace the temp paths. Your services (e.g. itemDefinitionsService.js) will then reference Cloudinary links instead of local media/ paths.

npm & Build: You rely on a minimal package.json—mostly for Leaflet, Pickr, and any bundling you might add. There’s no heavy Webpack or Rollup config yet; you include scripts via <script> tags in index.html.

Admin Workflow: Only the developer (you) signs in via Firebase Auth to unlock write rights. grantAdmin.js uses serviceAccountKey.json to give your UID the admin custom claim. That claim gatekeeps all definition modals. Public users never see the edit UIs.

4. Development Workflow & Collaboration

ChatGPT-driven coding: The entire codebase was generated and iteratively updated by the developer via ChatGPT prompts—no formal programming background required. Each time a change is requested, ChatGPT supplies both a succinct snippet explanation and the full updated file, ensuring no mismatches with prior versions.

Comment safeguards: Every file begins with a protected comment header. Contributors must preserve those lines (and the inline explanatory comments) unless they update or remove the associated code—this guarantees that any new or existing developer can quickly understand responsibility and change history.

Version alignment: Before applying any diff, the developer provides their current file version. Updates never assume the latest state; ChatGPT always asks for or verifies the existing file to prevent stale patches.

Task tracking: There’s no formal issue tracker—features, bug fixes, and refactors are coordinated through ChatGPT conversation threads and ephemeral to-do lists in comments. Any critical or recurring tasks (e.g. cleanup of event listeners) can be elevated to GitHub issues if desired.

5. Key Architectural Principles & Best Practices

Modularity: Each feature (map, markers, forms, services, UI components) is encapsulated in its own directory and file set, making it easier to locate and update specific functionality.

Consistency: Naming conventions (e.g., *Service.js, *Manager.js, *Builder.js, *Controller.js, *Modal.js) and file headers ensure that new contributors can predict where to find or place code.

Iterative Refactoring: Major refactors—like consolidating Firestore services or extracting shared UI helpers—are conducted slice by slice to avoid risking the entire application breaking at once.

Runtime Safety: Protected teardown methods, error propagation to the UI, and schema validation in services all aim to prevent silent failures or memory leaks.

Accessibility & Theming: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and CSS variables (default #E5E6E8 white color for font) are baked in so that the app is both user-friendly and visually consistent.

Extensibility: The createPreviewPanel and definitionModalShell functions, along with the generic definitions services, allow new marker types (e.g., events, safehouses) to be added with minimal new boilerplate.

ChatGPT Collaboration: With ChatGPT as the “pair programmer,” every update includes both a high-level rationale and full-file patches, ensuring clarity, version alignment, and maintainability.

6. Onboarding Steps for New Contributors

Clone & Install

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vbmap.git
cd vbmap
npm install
Firebase Setup

Copy serviceAccountKey.json.example to serviceAccountKey.json (admin only).

Populate .env or src/firebaseConfig.js with your Firebase project credentials.

Cloudinary Configuration

Sign into the project’s Cloudinary account.

In itemDefinitionsService.js (and other services), replace local media/images/... references with your Cloudinary URLs.

Local Serve

Simply open index.html in a browser, or run a lightweight server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx http-server . -p 8080
Authentication

Use the developer’s UID (pre-granted via grantAdmin.js) to sign in and unlock admin UIs.

Coding & Testing

For any change, fetch the current file, then apply ChatGPT-provided diffs.

Manually test both public (read-only) and admin (write) flows.

7. Future Roadmap & Maintenance Guidelines

Automated Tests & CI: Introduce Jest or Cypress tests for core flows (marker CRUD, modal open/close, list filtering).

Bundling & Optimization: Migrate to a bundler (Rollup/Webpack/Vite) to tree-shake unused code and enable ES module imports.

Versioned Releases: Tag stable versions (e.g., v1.0.0) and use GitHub Releases to track changes.

Documentation: Convert docu.txt into a structured Markdown guide, covering architecture, coding conventions, and deployment steps.

Scaling Considerations: Implement pagination or lazy-loading for definition lists, and optimize marker rendering for large maps.

Accessibility Audit: Run tools like Lighthouse or axe to catch and rectify any lingering ARIA or keyboard-nav gaps.
